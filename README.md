rbacDSL
=======

A text-based DSL for Role-Based Access Control

The default branch (rbacDSL-ng) is a complete re-write of the language, with the goal of making it easier to use. The 'master' branch contains the old version of the language, which will not be supported anymore.

## Features

+ Standard-compliant RBAC modelling (RBAC0, RBAC1, RBAC2)
+ User-defined constraints and automated model verification
+ Quickfixes, including model repairs to satisfy user-defined constraints
+ Models compile to XACML 3.0
